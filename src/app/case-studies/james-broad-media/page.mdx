# James Broad Media: Online Profile
### Figma, Astro, Tailwind, TypeScript
#### Vercel, Google Analytics, React, Cloudflare

>### tl;dr
>I created a media profile website for antiques dealer and TV personality James Broad. It scores 100 across the board in Google's Lighthouse

## problem
James Broad is an antiques dealer and TV personality. Over the last few years he has been increasing his online presence and is focussing increasingly on his TV work.

He wanted a website which showcased his television work, enabled media companies to get in contact regarding further television opportunities, and allowed his audience to get to know him a bit better.

## solution
We worked together using Figma to create an interactive mockup that was simple and clean, but that also allowed him to put his unique personality across.

When we were happy with the design, I implemented it using Astro and Tailwind (with Typescript) and deployed it on Vercel. I also integrated Google Analytics to allow him to track the success of his website, especially during TV appearances.

## results
The website scores 100 across the board in Google's Lighthouse and ranks #1 for James's name on Google despite his heavily active social media presence.
