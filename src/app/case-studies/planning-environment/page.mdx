# Sustainable Planning for the Energy Transition
### Typescript, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB
#### Figma, Rebase, GraphQL, gRPC, Sendgrid, Kubernetes

>### tl;dr
>I built a web app for planners managing teams of traveling technicians who install energy-saving products. It cut planning time by 35%.

## The problem
Installing energy-saving products (think solar panels, heat pumps, insulation etc) in peoples houses is a complex process. It often requires one or more technical inspections of the house to ensure the work is possible, is subject to regulations, and is highly sensitive to supply chain issues.

Planning teams need to have the key information about each job to hand, and tooling which allows them to manage their work with as few opportunities for human error as possible.

The process began by talking with the planners, many of whom were not highly technical, but who had a wealth of experience and domain knowledge. From their feedback, a detailed set of user stories was created:
- As a planner, I need to be able to see photos of the house so that I can assess that the right extra materials are included in the job.
- As a homeowner, I need to receive notifications about the progress of the job so that I can plan my day around the installation.
- As an installer, I need a checklist of the items that need to be signed off so that I can ensure the job is completed to a high standard.
- ...

I also created a set of mockups for a web-app which would allow them to manage their work. These mockups were then iterated on with the planners and installers to ensure they were easy to understand and use.

## The solution
### The front end
I built a Next.js app with Rebase as a component library. By using Apollo GraphQL to fetch data from the backend, it was possible to create a fast, responsive UI with optimistic updates and extensive client-side caching.

### The back end
There was a Node.js backend which exposed a GraphQL API. This made it easy to use and navigate around the complex web of information that is required to plan a job.

As of April 2023, more than â‚¬2 million euros worth of work had been planned via the platform, and it had achieved a 35% reduction in planning time, relative to jobs that were planned outside of the application.
