>### tl;dr
>I built a web app for planners managing teams of travelling technicians who install energy-saving products. It reduced planning time by 35%.

## problem
Installing energy-saving products (think solar panels, heat pumps, insulation, etc.) in people’s homes is a complex process. It often requires one or more technical inspections to ensure the work is feasible, is subject to regulations, and is highly sensitive to supply chain issues.

Planning teams need access to key information about each job, along with tools that allow them to manage their work while minimising opportunities for human error.

The process began with discussions with planners, many of whom were not highly technical but had extensive experience and domain knowledge. From their feedback, a detailed set of user stories was created:

- As a planner, I need to be able to see photos of the house so that I can ensure the right extra materials are included in the job.
- As a homeowner, I need to receive notifications about the progress of the job so that I can plan my day around the installation.
- As an installer, I need a checklist of the items that need to be signed off so that I can ensure the job is completed to a high standard.
- ...

I also created a set of mock-ups for a web app that would allow planners to manage their work. These mock-ups were then iterated on with planners and installers to ensure they were intuitive and easy to use.

## solution
### the front end
I built a Next.js app with Rebase as a component library. By using Apollo GraphQL to fetch data from the backend, I was able to create a fast, responsive UI with optimistic updates and extensive client-side caching.

The platform allowed planners to manage the installation jobs, including in-depth job information, photos, and notifications. It also included comprehensive sign-off flows for each different type of job, ensuring that consistency and quality of work were maintained. It also allowed the installation company to collect important feedback from the customers, meaning that the company could continue to improve their services.


### the back end
The backend was a Typescript Node.js application that exposed a GraphQL API, making it easy to navigate the complex web of information required for job planning.

## results
As of April 2023, more than €2 million worth of work had been planned via the platform, and it had achieved a 35% reduction in planning time compared to jobs planned outside the application.
