# Getting back on track: a technical appraisal and remediation plan
##
>### tl;dr
>I performed a technical audit of an underdelivered software project, identifying missing contractual obligations, and providing a clear remediation plan and cost estimate to be used in a legal dispute

##

## problem
A client approached me with a software project that had been delivered to them incomplete. It was missing key contractual obligations, including features and security requirements.

The client was working with a lawyer to determine the damages that they were able to claim from their contractor for the work that was not delivered.

The contractor claimed that many of the items from the contract were delivered but not visible. This was not verifiable by the client without a technical audit.

## solution
I performed an in-depth technical audit of the code delivered to the client and provided a series of documents assessing the damages incurred, including:
- **A technical appraisal** of the work that had been delivered, including a bug report and a list of missing features
- **A remediation plan** required to complete the contractual obligations, including a cost estimate
- **A list of advisory measures** to highlight potential areas for breach of duty of care

## results
I was able to identify a series of ciritcal issues, including security vulnerabilities, missing features and incorrectly configured infrastructure.

This provided a solid foundation for the client to understand what they had actually receieved from their contractor and what it would take to get the project to the state they had expected.

It streamlined the legal proceedings and allowed the client to focus on getting the business back on track.
